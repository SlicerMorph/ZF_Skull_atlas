# ZF_Skull_atlas
Adult zebrafish normative atlas used in Diamond et al. in progress.

Atlas was derived from microCT scans of 23 wild-type samples generated by MSBL (Watson et al., 2020) using ANTs. All individuals were reflected and included in the atlas building to generate a fully symmetric template. 

Contents:
downsampled Synthetic template
Skull segmentation (in 3D Slicer segmentation data format).
Pseudo-landmarks used in the analysis.
