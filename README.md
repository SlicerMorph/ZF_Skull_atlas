# ZF_Skull_atlas
Adult zebrafish normative atlas used in Diamond et al. 2022: https://doi.org/10.1242/bio.058948

Atlas was derived from microCT scans of 23 wild-type samples generated by MSBL (Watson et al., 2020) using ANTs. All individuals were reflected and included in the atlas building to generate a fully symmetric template.
